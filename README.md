## Overview
Fast fashion has caused a massive increase in the rate at which new trends are set.

A lot of companies make replica of luxury products at an affordable price. 

As a result it is getting difficult for the average consumer to select apparels from such a vast variety. 

The problem is further elevated by the lack of interaction with the product which exists in traditional shopping, since it is difficult to choose a apparel without trial.
